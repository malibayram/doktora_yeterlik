    "### Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Support is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset. In the above example, the support of {Milk} is 3/5 = 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence is an indication of how often the rule has been found to be true. In the above example, the confidence of {Milk} -> {Diapers} is 2/3 = 66.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lift\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if the two rules were independent. The expected support is the product of the itemset support values. In the above example, the lift of {Milk} -> {Diapers} is 60%/75% = 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conviction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conviction is the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y if they were dependent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. In the above example, the conviction of {Milk} -> {Diapers} is 1/(1-75%) = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage computes the difference between the observed frequency of X and Y appearing together and the frequency that would be expected if X and Y were independent. In the above example, the leverage of {Milk} -> {Diapers} is 60% - (75% * 75%) = 11.25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lift Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift Ratio is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if the two rules were independent. The expected support is the product of the itemset support values. In the above example, the lift ratio of {Milk} -> {Diapers} is 60%/75% = 80%.\n",

    "### The Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It is devised to operate on a database containing a lot of transactions, for instance, items brought by customers in a store. The Apriori algorithm needs a minimum support level as an input and a data set. The algorithm processes the dataset multiple times to discover frequently occurring itemsets. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the dataset. The Apriori algorithm reduces the number of itemsets that are to be examined during the search process. The algorithm uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found."
